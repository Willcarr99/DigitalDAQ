  Name:         settings-DPP.dat
  Created by:   W. Fox

  Contents:     Settings file for the Enge DAQ using the CAEN V1730.
                File is read and settings are applied by the frontend:
                fev1730-DPP.cxx. Settings defined in v1730DPP.c.
          
  Usage:        For settings applied to individual channels, use comma-
                separated values corresponding to "Enabled Channels".
                For settings applied to all channels, use a single value.

\********************************************************************/
0,1        ## Enabled Channels | 0-15
700        ## Long gate | ns, main charge integration gate
400        ## Short gate | ns, extra charge integration gate for pulse shape discrimination
110        ## Gate offset | ns, offset before trigger for long/short gates, Long gate < Short gate < Gate offset
0          ## Pre Trigger | ns (mult. of 8), offset before trigger for establishing baseline, if too low, = Gate offset + 38 ns
0          ## Trigger Hold-Off | ns (mult. of 8), gate after trigger for signal inhibition, if too low, stops at end of long gate
1          ## Gain | 0-5, charge/ch, 0 = 5fC, 1 = 20fC, 2 = 80fC, 3 = 320fC, 4 = 1.28pC, 5 = 5.12pC (assuming dynamic range = 2 Vpp)
0          ## Dynamic Range | 0 = 2 Vpp (default), 1 = 0.5 Vpp, input signal voltage dynamic range
1          ## negSignals | 1=yes, 0=no
32767      ## DC Offset | in DAC LSB Units
3          ## Trigger threshold | in mV
1          ## Discrimination Mode | 0 = LED mode, 1 = CFD mode
40         ## CFD Delay | ns, ignored if LED mode
75         ## CFD Fraction | %, ignored if LED mode

2          ## Input Smoothing | 0 = disabled, 1,2,3,4 = input pulse averaged over 2,4,8,16 samples, respectively
3          ## Mean Baseline Calc | 0 = fixed baseline, 1,2,3,4 = use 16,64,256,1024 samples, respectively
0          ## Fixed Baseline | in mV, 0 = disabled, Mean Baseline Calc must be 0 if enabled
0          ## Baseline Calc Restart | 0 = after trigger hold-off (default), 1 = after long gate
0          ## Pile Up Counted as a Trigger | 0 = disabled (default), 1 = enabled
0          ## Pile Up Rejection | 0 = disabled (default), 1 = enabled
0          ## Over-Range Rejection | 0 = disabled (default), 1 = enabled, rejects events when a sample is over/under dynamic range
0          ## Trigger Acquisition | 0 = trigger used to acquire event and propagated to motherboard (default), 1 = only propagated
0          ## Detect Signals with Opposite Polarity | 0 = enabled (default), 1 = disabled
0          ## Charge Zero Suppression Threshold | in LSB, 0 = disabled (default), cuts Q_Long < Q_thresh
0          ## Charge Pedestal | 0 = disable (default), 1 = enable, enabling adds a fixed value of 1024 to the charge
0          ## Trigger Hysteresis | 0 = enable (default), 1 = disable, enabling prevents re-triggering on the same pulse
0          ## Test Pulse Emulator | 0 = disable, 1 = 1 kHz, 2 = 10 kHz, 3 = 100 kHz, 4 = 1 MHz

0          ## Trigger Mode | 0 = Normal (Default), 1 = Coincidence, 2 = Anti-Coincidence (Not available)
0          ## Trigger Propagation From Motherboard | Single value, 0 = disabled (default), 1 = enabled (required for coincidences)
0          ## Trigger Counting Mode | 0 = trigger only from accepted events (default), 1 = from all (even rejected) events
0          ## Shaped Trigger (Coincidence) Width | ns, mult. of 8, max 8176 ns, apply same to all participating chs, 0 = Normal mode
